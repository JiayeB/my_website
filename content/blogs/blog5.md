# Why investment banking?

- IB interests me since I learned how the financial market functions and the **important role** IB plays when I was a freshman at college

- Allows me to see **practical and tangible impact**

- Excitement to work with **dynamic team** with smart people


# Experiences

-   [**CITIC Capital**](http://www.citiccapital.com/SitePages/home-eng.aspx)

I supported desk researches of industries and companies, participated experts calls, and prepared deal presentation materials for investment committee.

Here is a recently announced news of an [investment of an European EV charger manufacturer](http://www.citiccapital.com/News%20Files/2021-1018%20Trustar%20Capital%20Closes%20Investment%20in%20Intramco.pdf), which I assisted during my internship.


-   [**Benoit & Associes Investment Bankers**](https://www.benoit-associes.com/) 

I worked at B&A for six months and really enjoyed my time there. \
Our team acted as financial advisor for both buy-side and sell-side M&A projects for Chinese and French clients.\
During my internship, I was exposed to real estate, micro credit, and healthy snack industries, which are all exciting and inspiring.


-   [**China International Capital Corporation (CICC)**](https://en.cicc.com/)

The most significant part of this internship is the IPO projects I was engaged:

1. Luckin Coffee (a leading coffee chain company)
2. So Young International (a leading online medical aesthetic platform in China)
