In the course CA09 **Data Analytics for Finance** at LBS, it was my first time to learn coding. Thanks to the professor's teaching and rich hands-on examples, I gradually got familiar with the data thinking and manipulation skills, and I am proud to present here some of my work I have done during the process.

# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

We will look at a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <-read_csv(here::here("data","movies.csv")) 
glimpse(movies)

```

## Use data import, inspection, and cleaning skills to solve questions:

- Are there any missing values (NAs)? Are all entries distinct or are there duplicate entries?
```{r, movies}
skimr::skim(movies)
# the number of double entries based on movies
length(subset(movies$title,duplicated(movies$title)))

movies_unique<- movies %>% distinct(title, year, .keep_all = TRUE)
length(subset(movies_unique$title,duplicated(movies_unique$title)))
View(movies_unique)
```


- Produce a table with the count of movies by genre, ranked in descending order
```{r}
library(tidytext)
library(janeaustenr)
library(dplyr)

movies_unique %>% 
    count(genre,wt = NULL, sort = TRUE, name = NULL) #%>% # group by genre
```


- Produce a table with the average gross earning and budget (`gross` and `budget`) by genre. Calculate a variable `return_on_budget` which shows how many $ did a movie make at the box office for each $ of its budget. Ranked genres by this `return_on_budget` in descending order
```{r}

tab1<-movies_unique %>% 
    group_by(genre) %>% # group by genre
    summarise(gross = mean(gross, na.rm = TRUE), 
              budget = mean(budget, na.rm = TRUE),
              return_on_budget=gross/budget)

arrange(tab1, desc(return_on_budget))
  
```


- Produce a table that shows the top 15 directors who have created the highest gross revenue in the box office. Don't just show the total gross amount, but also the mean, median, and standard deviation per director.
```{r}
movies_unique %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(  tot=sum(gross,na.rm = TRUE),
              avg = mean(gross, na.rm = TRUE), 
              median = median(gross, na.rm = TRUE),
              std=sd(gross))%>%
  slice_max(order_by =(tot), n=15)
  
```


- Finally, ratings. Produce a table that describes how ratings are distributed by genre. We don't want just the mean, but also, min, max, median, SD and some kind of a histogram or density graph that visually shows how ratings are distributed. 
```{r}
dat1<-movies_unique %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(  avg=mean(rating,na.rm = TRUE),
              min = min(rating, na.rm = TRUE), 
              max = max(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
              median = median(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
              std=sd(rating,na.rm = TRUE))

dat1

movies_unique %>% 
ggplot( aes(x=genre, y=rating))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  geom_jitter(width=0.15)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))+
   theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Rating by genre",
    subtitle = "Documentary perform well",
    x = "genre",
    y = NULL)

```

## Use `ggplot` to solve questions:

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `cast_facebook_likes`. 

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
movies_unique %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  geom_point(size=1, shape=1) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between gross profit and cast_facebook_like",
    subtitle = "No relationship",
    x = "Facebook likes",
    y = "Gross earnings (US$)"
  )

```
**There is no relationship between these two variables**

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `budget`. 

```{r, gross_on_budget}

movies_unique %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = budget, y = gross)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 10000000, height = 10000000)+
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between budget and gross",
    subtitle = "Positive relationship",
    x = "Budget",
    y = "Gross earnings (US$)"
  )
```
**There is a positive relationship between the two variables** 

  - Examine the relationship between `gross` and `rating`. 

```{r, gross_on_rating}
movies_unique %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = rating, y = gross)) +
  geom_point(size=1, shape=1) +
  theme_bw()+
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between gross profit and rating",
    subtitle = "No relationship",
    x = "Rating",
    y = "Gross earnings (US$)"
  )+facet_wrap(~genre, scales = "free")
```

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Here I explored whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors.

First, I would plot these confidence intervals using my R code:

```{r}

# creat dateframe containing confidence intervals data for two directors
director <- c('Tim Burton','Steven Spielberg')
meanrating <- c(6.93,7.57)
lower<- c(6.53,7.27)
upper<- c(7.33,7.87)

df_CIrating<- data.frame(director,meanrating,lower,upper)

# reproduce confidence intervals plot 
ggplot(df_CIrating,aes(x=meanrating,y=factor(director,level = c('Tim Burton','Steven Spielberg')),color=director))+
  geom_linerange(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),width = 2)+
  geom_pointrange(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),size = 1)+
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper),size=2,width = 0.05)+
  geom_text(aes(label=meanrating),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=8,face="bold")+
  geom_text(aes(label=lower,x=lower),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=5)+
  geom_text(aes(label=upper,x=upper),hjust=0.5, vjust=-1,color="black",size=5)+
  theme_bw() + #delete background
  xlab("Mean IMDB Rating") +
  labs(title = "Do Spielbarg and Burton have the same IMDB ratings?", 
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "bold"))+
  geom_rect(color= "grey",fill = "grey", alpha = 0.5, 
    mapping = aes_string(x = "meanrating", y = "director"), 
    xmin = 7.27,
    xmax = 7.33,
    ymin = -Inf,
    ymax = Inf)


```

In addition, I ran a hpothesis test, using both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where I assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, I listed the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value.

**Null hypotheses: The difference in mean IMDB ratings between Spielbarg and Burton is equal to zero** 
**Alternate hypotheses: The difference in mean IMDB ratings between Spielbarg and Burton is not equal to zero** 
**Test statistic for this hypotheses test should be the difference in sample means of ratings for two directors minus the term (μ1-μ2) which is equal to zero in this situation, divided by the standard deviation of the difference between the two sample means** 
**The associated t-stat = 2.70** 
**Since the t-stat 2.70 is much greater than 2, we reject the null hypotheses. In conclusion, the mean difference between two directors' movie ratings is really different from zero and therefore there is a significant difference in IMDB rating for them**

Then I load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
skimr::skim(movies)
```

I first ran t-test:

```{r}
#Filter original data for two directors only, for t-test convenience

movies_rating1 <- movies%>%
  filter(director==c("Steven Spielberg"))

movies_rating2 <- movies%>%
  filter(director==c("Tim Burton"))

spielberg_burton <- rbind(movies_rating1, movies_rating2)

# Have a look at the statistics of two director rating samples
mosaic::favstats(rating ~ director,data=spielberg_burton)

# Run t-test
t.test(rating ~ director,data=spielberg_burton)


```

Then I used **permute** simulation approach to test:

```{r}
#Filter original data for two directors only, for simulation 

movies_rating1 <- movies %>%
  filter(director == c("Steven Spielberg"))

movies_rating2 <- movies %>%
  filter(director == c("Tim Burton"))

spielberg_burton <- rbind(movies_rating1, movies_rating2)

#Simulation
set.seed(1234)

ratings_in_null_world <- spielberg_burton %>%
  # Specify the variable of interest
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  
  # Hypothesize a null of no (or zero) difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # Generate a bunch of simulated samples
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # Find the mean difference of each sample
  calculate(stat = "diff in means",
            order = c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton"))

# Calculate the p-value
ratings_in_null_world %>%
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = 0.64, direction = "both")

ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize()

```

**Both t-test and simulation-based null distribution showed the null hypothesis should be rejected, implying there is a significant difference in IMDB rating for two directors**
