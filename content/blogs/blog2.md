After I graduated from Tsinghua in 2020, I deferred my original plan to attend Columbia University and took a gap year. \
At first, I was uncertain if this decision was right or not, but my gap year turned out to be a meaningful and exciting experience which I won't regret!

# Travel

I traveled to other provinces in China:
