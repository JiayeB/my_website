title: To do list 
---

I always have to do list and an organized calendar to remind me of what I need to do. For short and long term future, I also have plans to navigate and adjust myself:

# Professional

There is a frequent question in interviews: where do you see yourself in 5 year?

That would be my answer here:

- In the short run, I would devote myself to investment banking, keep learning diverse transactions/projects and expand my skillsets. 

- In the long run, I am dedicated to pursue a sustainable career in IBD and in the future I would be able to take the lead of teams.


# Interests & Skills

- **Keep exercise and learn new sports**\
It is critical to keep physically healthy and I am interested in snowboarding which looks so exciting.\

I've always wanted to learn a second foreign language and I plan to learn French this year through online courses. \

- **Learn Accounting**\
It is important to command great accounting to kick off a career and I would spend time learning more regarding different accounting systems to be prepared.
